```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Notice the default chunk options:

-   `include=False` means that output from the `setup` chunk will not be shown in the document.

-   `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)` specifies that the code for each chunk will appear in the document, unless otherwise specified in the chunk.

-   In the second example chunk below, the option `echo=F` is used to hide the code from that chunk and just show the plot.

-   `echo=F` is commonly used when making slides, documents, or a dashboard for a non-technical audience.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

<br>
 
<br>
 
<br>
 
<br>
 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
